# MapWatcher

An iPad app written in Swift 3 to observe the currently played map on a set of servers and notify the user if a given map is active. If multiple servers are given, it automatically observes the one with more active players on it.

The application uses Alamofire and AlamofireImage through Cocoa Pods. The code also demonstrates how to interface code written in Objective C from Swift.
